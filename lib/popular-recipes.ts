        "Preheat oven to 400 degrees.  Position a rack in the lower third of the oven.  Rinse the chicken, then dry it very well with paper towels, inside and out.\nPlace apples, rosemary, 3 lemons, onions, and garlic in a single layer in shallow roasting pan. Season with salt and pepper. Toss well and pour in the vinegar. Season the chicken well with the rub and place breast-side-up on top of the veggies and fruits. Put the rest of the veggies and fruit in the cavity of the chicken.\nRoast for 30 minutes, until the breast is firm and just beginning to brown in spots. Using tongs, turn the chicken breast-down and roast for 20 minutes longer, until the skin is lightly browned and the thermometer registers 175 to 180.\nTilt the chicken to drain the cavity juices into the pan and remove the goodies from the inside and bottom of pan.  Now transfer the bird to a cutting board. Remove the rack from the pan and spoon off the fat. Set the pan over high heat. Add the stock and cook, scraping up any browned bits and leftover pieces of goodies. Squeeze the last lemon to release the juices. Carve the chicken and pass the chunky jus at the table.",

      instructions:
        "In a small bowl combine the cumin, chili powder, paprika, 1 minced clove of garlic and 2 tbsp of olive oil.  Slice the tofu very thin, about 1/2 inch per slice, then rub each slice with the spice mixture.  Set aside.\nHeat about 1 tbsp olive oil over medium high heat in a large pan.  Add the tofu, a few slices at a time, watching carefully.  Flip after about 1-2 minutes.  Cook until done  I let mine cook about 2-3 minutes per side.   Half each piece, wrap with bacon, then set aside and cover with aluminum foil.\nDo NOT wash the pan out  now put it back on the stove, reduce heat to medium and add the remaining minced garlic clove, 1 tbsp olive oil and diced jalapeno.  Saute until the peppers are almost getting a little bit brown and everything is fragrant.   Add the cream cheese, 1/2 cup cheese and chicken broth.  Whisk and bring to a slight boil; reducing the heat if you have to, preventing it from scorching. Once its combined and a sauce consistency, salt and pepper to your taste and pour into a separate bowl; cover.\nBring the heat back up to medium-high, and add another tablespoon of olive oil to the pan.  When hot add one tortilla at a time, turning after about 15-20 seconds to the other side.  Your end result will be tortillas slightly brown around the edges and a little bubbly in the middle.\nSet aside and cover.\nTo serve, stuff a tortilla with bacon-wrapped tofu, and drizzle the jalapeno creme on top and some Monterey jack.",

      instructions:
        "Using a vegetable peeler, remove wide, long strips of potato peel and set aside. Finish peeling the potatoes. ( I had probably around a 1 1/2 c. peels.)\nHeat a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Add chopped bacon and cook until crisp, about 10 minutes. Remove bacon to a paper towel-lined plate.\nTo the fat in the pan, add the potato skins and cook until crisp about 10 min. (You want to be sure they are crisp, or else they'll just be soggy and greasy, I took mine out at just the 10 minute mark and they weren't truly crisp, so I just spread them out on a cookie sheet and baked them in a 400 degree oven for around 5 minutes and they were very crisp after that.)\nRemove the crisped potato skins to the paper-lined plate with the bacon. Add the onion to the fat remaining in the pan, cook until tender and lightly browned, about 6 minutes. Add the thyme and flour, cook and stir for about a minute. Slowly whisk in the chicken broth and the half n half. Add the potatoes and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover and cook until the potatoes are very tender, (you should be able to easly crush a piece of potato against the side of the pot with the back of a wooden spoon) about 10-15 minutes.\nUsing a blender, puree (in small batches) all but about 3 cups of the soup. Using a potato masher or your wooden spoon, lightly crush the potato chunks in the reserved potion of the soup. Add the pureed soup back to the pot and return to a low burner to keep the soup hot. Add in the 2 c. cheese, stir until melted, then add in the sour cream, stir well. Season to taste with salt & pepper. (Sometimes I like to add some of the crisped bacon into the soup mixture at this point, but that's optional.)\nTo serve, top bowls of soup with crisped bacon and potato skins, additional cheddar, sour cream and sliced scallion.",

        "Preheat your oven to 450 degrees F and line a large baking sheet with foil. Spray it generously with non-stick spray. Set aside.To one shallow bowl, add the flour. To a second shallow bowl, add the egg wash (2 eggs mixed with 1 tablespoon of water); and to a third shallow bowl, combine the bread crumbs, salt, garlic powder and cayenne pepper.Dredge the chicken strips in the flour, shaking to get rid of any excess. Transfer to the egg wash and fully coat. Finally, place the chicken strips in the panko bread crumb mixture and press to adhere where necessary. Place the chicken strips on the prepared baking sheet and spray generously with a non-stick spray.

        "Rinse beef, pat dry, and cut across the grain into 1/8-inch-thick slices about 3 inches long. In a small bowl, mix beef with 1/4 cup Korean Marinade.\nRemove and discard bean stem ends and strings. Cut beans diagonally in 3-inch lengths. Cut carrot into matchstick-size pieces about 3 inches long.\nIn a 14-inch wok or 12-inch frying pan over high heat, mix 1/2 cup water, beans, and carrot. Cover and stir occasionally just until tender to bite, about 3 minutes. Drain; immerse in cold water. Drain when cool. In a bowl, mix with vinegar, sesame oil, sugar, and salt to taste.\nPlace wok over high heat; when hot, add salad oil. Add beef with liquid in bowl; stir until meat is no longer pink, about 2 minutes. Add remaining marinade and broth to pan; stir until boiling.\nScoop rice into bowls; add beef and sauce, then vegetables and seasonings. Sprinkle with onions and sesame seed.\nThis recipe yields 4 servings.\nComments: If you can't find toasted sesame seed, stir regular sesame seed in a frying pan over low heat until golden, 1 minute.",
